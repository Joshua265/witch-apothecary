    Witch: Can you tell me more about the fatigue? How long have you been feeling this way?
    Helena: It all started a couple of weeks ago. I’ve been feeling drained, especially after work. I just can’t shake off the tiredness.
    Witch: How long has the fatigue been persistent? Did anything change recently to make it worse?
    Helena: It's been this way for a few weeks now, and I think it's been getting worse with my long hours of work. I’m always sewing and don’t really take breaks.
